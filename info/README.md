## Description
*Watch the computer struggle against the chains it put itself in! Watch the computer try to drink the water it moves out of reach! Watch the computer push a rock up a hill and knock it down again! In a joyful infinite loop! One must imagine CPU Sisyphus happy!*

*CPU Edition* is a version of my "classic" game [*Let's Play: Ancient Greek Punishment*](https://www.pippinbarr.com/lets-play-ancient-greek-punishment/info) altered to be played entirely by a CPU player instead of a human. So, you just kind of watch. It was good enough for Venice!
