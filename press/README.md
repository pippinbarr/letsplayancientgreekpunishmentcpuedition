## History

*Let's Play: Ancient Greek Punishment: CPU Edition!* came about as a natural extension of my continuing series of games based on, well, ancient Greek punishments. To this point, I'd already made a reconfiguration of the game set in an art gallery (the [Art Edition Edition](https://www.pippinbarr.com/2015/01/14/lets-play-lets-play-ancient-greek-punishment-art-edition-edition/)) and one in which the human player can 'win' against the various punishments (the [Limited Edition](https://www.pippinbarr.com/2016/06/21/lets-play-ancient-greek-punishment-limited-edition/)).

Along with that, I've spent a fairly substantial amount of time thinking about the idea of computers the context of videogames as these simultaneously indefatigable and fragile agents. Notably in a game like [Best Chess](https://www.pippinbarr.com/2015/07/30/best-chess/) I was interested in the tension between the brute fact that the game contains an algorithm that will solve chess over time (kind of like The Terminator) and the fact that technology itself can't survive over time (it becomes obsolete, it fails, etc.). With *Best Chess* in mind, it made sense to take one more step and completely remove the player from the equation, so that we have a game "by the computer, for the computer" in a sense (Abraham Lincoln would be proud).

Thus, *Let's Play: Ancient Greek Punishment: CPU Edition!* is a game that is not only represented/simulated by the computer, but is also *played* by the computer as well. There's plenty of meditation on both the metaphysics and specifics of this available in the [posts I've written about the game](http://www.pippinbarr.com/tag/lets-play-ancient-greek-punishment-cpu-edition?order=asc). In the end, though, I really do just find there's something moving about watching the computer doggedly struggling as Prometheus, Sisyphus, and the rest. Most importantly, it *feels like something* to watch the computer play, and not just like watching an animated GIF or video file, for example: It's really happening. Again and again. And again.

And again.
